# Quest Story Integration Design

Status: `Holy Relics Staging And Postgame Tavern V1 Implemented`

This document owns quest-system changes whose purpose is to stage story
information, preserve mystery, and keep quest guidance aligned with the
Forsaken Tenet canon. It complements `STORY_AND_ENDGAME_DESIGN.md`, which owns
the late-game Vesperion, Voluntas, Liminal Gap, and true-final route.

## Holy Relics Staged Mystery Chain

The level-1 main quest no longer tells the player to collect all six Holy
Relics immediately. That framing is mechanically useful but narratively too
certain: early NPCs should not understand the ultimate goal, the relic pattern,
or the identities behind the conflict.

The shipped chain starts with Sergeant-led uncertainty:

1. `Uncertain Reports` introduces patrol losses, sealed rooms, old symbols, and
   contradictory witness accounts.
2. `Cry Havoc!` points at the Barghest as a dangerous lead near one sealed
   chamber, not as the confirmed first guardian of six relics.
3. Finding the first relic updates `Uncertain Reports` to a report-back stage.
4. Turning in `Uncertain Reports` creates `The Holy Relics` as the long
   collection quest.
5. `The Holy Relics` then preserves the existing six-relic collection and final
   threshold gating behavior.

Early-game copy must not name Vesperion, Voluntas, the busboy identity, the
Hooded Figure truth, or true-final route mechanics. It may hint at old
principles, relic-light, sealed chambers, and incomplete reports.

## Late-Game Quest Continuity Hooks

Late-game quest copy can acknowledge story truths only after the relevant route
has earned them. This document owns quest-facing continuity language; the
larger Vesperion/Voluntas route still belongs to
`STORY_AND_ENDGAME_DESIGN.md`.

### Red Dragon Continuity

The Red Dragon encounter currently feeds ordinary progression, Lancer/Dragoon
Kaelenon restoration, and Thaumaturgist Dragon Calling. Quest text should
separate those meanings without making one route invalidate another.

Allowed copy direction:

- Hooded Figure/Red Dragon progression can describe the boss as a dangerous
  barrier and source of draconic power.
- Lancer/Dragoon `Recover` text can reveal Kaelenon as a trapped or restored
  identity inside the encounter.
- Zahhak unlock text can frame the summon as a draconic echo, spirit, pact, or
  aftermath binding rather than the same restored person.
- Non-Lancer/Dragoon victories remain narratively complete and should not be
  described as failed rescues.

Any copy-only continuity pass must preserve current quest names, boss target,
floor gate, rewards, summon unlock behavior, class unlock behavior, and
boss-room state. Mechanical changes require a promoted class/story spec.

### Postgame Town Dialogue

After `main_story_complete`, selected NPCs may receive lightweight reactive
dialogue about the Busboy's absence, the Waitress/Joffrey tragedy, the changed
town atmosphere, or the hero's return from the final threshold. This should be
local flavor and closure, not a hidden quest chain.

Postgame dialogue must not:

- reopen completed quests;
- create new required objectives;
- remove town services;
- alter bounties, shops, church, inn, barracks, or storage behavior;
- imply that Voluntas erases grief or reverses deaths.

The first slice is implemented for the Barkeep, Waitress, and Soldier. It is
gated only by `main_story_complete`, remains repeat-safe across saves, and uses
the shared reactive-hint path consumed by Pygame.

## Quest System Contract

Quest records may optionally define staged metadata:

- `Stage`: the current stage key saved on the player's accepted quest.
- `Stages`: stage definitions containing display text, objective/help text, and
  trigger identifiers.

Non-staged quests remain valid and ignore these fields.

Shared core quest-progress helpers own story quest synchronization so Pygame
does not duplicate relic or staged-objective rules. The helper is responsible
for:

- syncing staged quest progress after relic pickup;
- syncing aggregate relic collection completion;
- creating `The Holy Relics` after `Uncertain Reports` is turned in;
- defensively collapsing obsolete immediate `The Holy Relics` entries when
  encountered; this is normalization, not a compatibility guarantee.

## Persisted Quest Normalization

When the obsolete pre-staging `The Holy Relics` entry is encountered, current
normalization replaces it according to restored relic state:

- `0` relics becomes active `Uncertain Reports`.
- `1-5` relics becomes active staged `The Holy Relics`.
- `6` relics becomes completed staged `The Holy Relics`.
- turned-in relic quests remain turned in after normalization.

Normalization happens after special inventory and quest data are restored, so the
relic count reflects the actual saved inventory.

## Implementation Notes

- Quest content lives in `src/core/data/content/quests.json`.
- Staged relic quest synchronization and missing-field normalization live in
  `src/core/quest_progress.py`.
- Quest-state normalization is called from `src/core/save_system/player.py`
  after special inventory restoration.
- Pygame quest turn-in paths call the shared quest-progress helper.
- Relic discovery copy uses `src/core/map_tiles/rules.py` so presentation and
  core validation share the same mapping and fallback.
- Postgame tavern fallout lives in `src/core/town.py`; Pygame uses the shared
  non-mutating reactive-hint source.

## Regression Targets

- A new game offers `Uncertain Reports`, not `The Holy Relics`, at level 1.
- `Uncertain Reports` contains no six-relic, Vesperion, or Voluntas spoiler.
- `Cry Havoc!` remains the Barghest quest and keeps its existing level, target,
  reward, and completion behavior.
- Finding Triangulus marks `Uncertain Reports` ready to report without naming
  late-game identities.
- Turning in `Uncertain Reports` creates active `The Holy Relics`.
- The six-relic count and completion behavior remain correct in Pygame quest
  menus and headless core validation.
- Current quest-state normalization covers 0, 1, 5, 6, completed, and turned-in
  relic states.
- Red Dragon continuity copy distinguishes progression victory, Kaelenon
  restoration, and Zahhak binding without changing quest gates or rewards.
- Postgame town dialogue appears only after `main_story_complete`, is
  repeat-safe, and does not mutate quest/shop/bounty/town service state.
