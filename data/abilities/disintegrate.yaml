  Death spell with instant kill potential OR massive damage.
  
  First attempts instant kill based on CHA vs CON check (reduced by resistances).
  
  If kill fails, deals damage equal to CHA + 25% of target's current HP.
  
  Can be dodged with luck for 50% damage reduction.
  
  Cannot be reflected or absorbed by Mana Shield (pierces defenses).

  Used by: Lich, Archvile, Mind Flayer, other powerful spellcasters.
  
  Very expensive (65 mana) - usually used as finishing move or when desperate.
  
  Counter: High CON, elemental resistances (reduce kill chance), luck (dodge damage).
